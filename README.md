"This is a comparative analysis of different motion planning algorithms in a High-Dimensional Configuration Space"



Requirements:
1. Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox
Steps: Open http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox
and download RTB 9.10. Unzip the contents, Open rvctools and 
run the startup_rvc.m program.
2. Matlab_R2017b

Instructions for running the program:
1. Clone the repository and unzip all files.
2. Run startup_rvc.m by downloading the Robotics toolbox as 
per above instructions. 
3. From this projet, Open startup_motion.m and run it as 
(startup_motion("algorithmType")). This will run the program 
for the given workspace. Once the program finishes, one 
can see the trajectory of the robot in moving from start
to goal configurations in the accompanying plot.
4. To test out other algorithms, just change the algorithm Type.
